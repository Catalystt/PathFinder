# PathFinder
This is an Android Application that can load in maps (.svg) and allows you to plot two points: start point and end point. 
Using an path finder algorithm it can display a path that avoids walls/objects if there is anything in between you and destination.
Or give you a direct path to your destination if there are no obstructions in your way. 
It will track you're movements and directions with an accelerometer and magnetic field sensors, and update the path and instructions accordingly.
